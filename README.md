To do this project we scraped Euronext's website (https://live.euronext.com/en)

The objective we set for ourselves was to compare european indices by scraping only the level of one main index per country (available on Euronext)

Thus, we selected the following indices:

    - CAC40 : France
    - AEX : Amsterdam
    - BEL20 : Belgium
    - PSI20 : Lisbonne
    - ISEQ20 : Dublin
    - OBX : Oslo

With the prices of each index we first plotted the related levels to compare the movements, and added a daily recap along with an overall recap, containg metrics like the highs, lows, means, volatility, open and close prices.
